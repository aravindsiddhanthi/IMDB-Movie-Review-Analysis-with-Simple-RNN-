# IMDB Movie Review Analysis with Simple RNN

Developed a sentiment analysis model for classifying IMDB movie reviews as positive or negative using a Simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The model was trained on the IMDB dataset and deployed as an interactive web application using Streamlit. Implemented text preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, word indexing, and sequence padding. The system provides real-time sentiment classification with confidence scores, enabling users to analyze movie reviews effectively.
