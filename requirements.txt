It looks like the embedding_5 layer in your Sequential model is not properly built yet,
 which is why the parameter count is 0 and the output shape is unknown (?). Here are a few possible reasons and solutions:

Possible Reason:


You haven't specified the input shape correctly.

In Keras, some layers (like Embedding) are not automatically built unless the input shape is provided explicitly.

You're using Sequential() but haven't added layers properly.

If your model is defined but not built correctly, it might not show the expected number of parameters.

The model hasn't been compiled or received input yet.

Some layers remain unbuilt until they receive an actual input
